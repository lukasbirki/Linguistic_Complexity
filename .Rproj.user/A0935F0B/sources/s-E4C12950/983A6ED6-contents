#Each word in the focal question and answer has a word frequency in the English language. QUAID has tested out a number of databases and lexicons that have information about word frequency and familiarity in the English language, including Francis and Kucera (1982), the MRC psycholinguistic database (Coltheart, 1981), and the WordNet lexicon (Miller, Beckwith, Fellbaum, Gross, & Miller, 1990). The best criterion that we found for determining whether a word was unfamiliar was whether the word either (1) has an MRC familiarity value ofless than 500 or (2) is not in the WordNet lexicon.
